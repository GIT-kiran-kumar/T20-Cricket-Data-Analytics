# 🏏 Cricket Data Analytics Project (Beginner Friendly)

This is an **end-to-end Data Analytics project** based on a T20 cricket dataset, inspired by the [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/resources/data-analytics-project-for-beginners) tutorial.  
It covers the complete data analytics workflow — from data collection and preprocessing to dashboard creation and storytelling — using **Python** and **Power BI**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to help selectors choose the **Best 11 players** for a T20 cricket match using data-driven insights.  
We perform **data extraction, cleaning, transformation**, and finally build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to present our findings.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains historical T20 cricket statistics for players across multiple seasons.  
It includes batting, bowling, and fielding stats in **CSV** and **JSON** formats.

### Data Files:
- `t20_csv_files.zip` — Raw data in CSV format
- `t20_json_files.zip` — Raw data in JSON format
- `t20_data_preprocessing.ipynb` — Python notebook for cleaning & preprocessing

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Data Preprocessing)
- **Pandas** (Data Cleaning)
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization)
- **DAX** (Measures & Calculations)
- **Excel** (Supporting calculations)
- **Web Scraping** (Data collection scripts)

---

## 📊 Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Collection**
   - Web scraping cricket stats from public sources
   - Exporting data in CSV/JSON format

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type conversions
   - Feature engineering for performance metrics

3. **Data Modelling**
   - Importing cleaned data into Power BI
   - Establishing relationships between tables

4. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Building visuals for batting, bowling, and all-rounder performance
   - Slicers for team, role, and time period
   - Final **Best 11 Player Selection** dashboard

5. **Storytelling**
   - Explaining methodology & player selection criteria
   - Presenting insights to decision-makers
